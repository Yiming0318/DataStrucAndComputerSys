# Lab 5: Style and cLint
Who did you work with? Myself


How long did this take you? half hour


Write a sentence or two about what file you chose to clean up, and note something about what the most common or annoying issue you had to fix. 
Most problems I faced is "Tab found; better to use spaces", I should use two spaces instead of tab.
In addition, I need to give space before each {} or ()



[Optional] What did you like about this lab? clint.py makes life easy



[Optional] What could be improved about this lab?  Cannot use tab is super uncomfortable
